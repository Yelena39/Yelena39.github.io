          <h2>Integration test case</h2>
          <p>If the project architecture is complex and a lot of microservises are involved, it's important to track the request all the way from user initiation input to the final system and also track the response all the way back to the user during integration testing.
          </p>
          <p>Also, within one big system, some parts might have been developed a long time ago and currently are just being supported, and other parts might be fresh and up-to-date, therefore special adapter services might be needed to provide proper data exchange. In this case, it's essential to test request/response mapping for all the keys while the data is being transferred from one service to another.
          </p>
          <p>Here is rough sample of integration test case when user submits some application through a web interface.</p>

          <p><pre class="solution">
  Preconditions:
      Valid user account.
      Access to logs.
      Access to database.

  Execution steps:
      Step 1. Go to http://... and authorize  
      Expected result: Authorization is successfull

      Step 2. Go to "Applications" menu and "Submit new application" tab 
      Expected result: "Submit new application" page is open

      Step 3. Fill in all the fields of the application form and hit "Submit" - take screenshot of all the data entered and the time of submitting
      Expected result: "Your application is currently being processed" page is open (UI)

      Step 4. Access the logs system and find the corresponding request in the Requestor service using the time of submitting from step 3, copy its id
      Expected result: The corresponding request is located (UI -> Requestor)

      Step 5. Check if the corresponding request body has all the data from the application form at step 3, and all the keys comply with documentation
      Expected result: The request is correct

      Step 6. Filter out the logs by the request id to track all the services called afterwards, and check if the next technical adapter service was called.
      Expected result: Correct technical adapter service was called (Requestor -> Adapter)

      Step 7. Check if the corresponding request from Requestor to Adapter has all the needed data, it's correct, and all the keys comply with documentation
      Expected result: The request data is correct

      Step 8. Check if the technical adapter service sends request to a destination service.
      Expected result: Correct destination service was called (Adapter -> Destination service)

      Step 9. Check if the corresponding request from Adapter to destination service was properly mapped, has all the needed data, which is correct, and all the keys comply with documentation
      Expected result: The request data is correct

      Step 10. Check the response of destination service.
      Expected result: The response has the correct message about application submitting success. (Destination service -> Adapter)

      Step 11. Find corresponding submitted application data in the database.
      Expected result: The application data is recorded in database, all of the sent in step 3 application data is present and correct.

      Step 12. Check if the response of destination service was mapped by Adapter and sent back to the Requestor service.
      Expected result: The response was correctly mapped and sent to the Requestor. (Adapter -> Requestor)

      Step 13. Check if the response of destination service was sent from the Requestor service to UI.
      Expected result: The response was sent to UI. (Requestor -> UI)

      Step 14. Check the status of application in user interface.
      Expected result: The status of application is now "Your application has been successfully submitted" (UI)
